//OUTPUT

Enter the number of cities: 4
Enter the number of roads: 5
Enter the details of each road:
1 2 3
1 3 6
2 3 2
2 4 1
3 4 5
Enter the source city: 1
In this example, we have 4 cities (1, 2, 3, and 4) connected by 5 roads with different distances.

Based on this input, the program would compute the shortest distances from city 1 to all other cities using the Bellman-Ford algorithm and display the results as follows:

Shortest distances from city 1 to all other cities:
City 1: 0
City 2: 3
City 3: 5
City 4: 4
Here's what the output means:

The shortest distance from city 1 to itself is 0.
The shortest distance from city 1 to city 2 is 3.
The shortest distance from city 1 to city 3 is 5.
The shortest distance from city 1 to city 4 is 4.
Each line in the output corresponds to a city, and the value represents the shortest distance from the source city (city 1) to
tIn this example, you have 4 cities and 5 roads connecting them. The source city is 1. 
The program uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to compute the shortest distances from city 1 to all other cities. 
The output shows the shortest distance from city 1 to each city. City 1 is at a distance of 0 from itself, 
city 2 is at a distance of 1, city 3 is at a distance of 3, and 
city 4 is at a distance of 6.hat particular city.
